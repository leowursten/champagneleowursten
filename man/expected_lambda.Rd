\title{Expected number of guests from weather}
\usage{
expected_lambda(city_weather)
}
\arguments{
\item{city_weather}{A \code{City_Weather} object.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar, expected number of guests.
}
\description{
Computes the expected number of guests based on a simple log-link model:
\deqn{\lambda = exp(0.5 + 0.5 T - 3 H + 0.001 P),}
where \eqn{T} is temperature (°C), \eqn{H} humidity (in percent, 0–100),
and \eqn{P} pressure (hPa).
}
\examples{
cw <- CityWeather("Paris", temperature = 20, humidity = 50, pressure = 1010)
expected_lambda(cw)

}
